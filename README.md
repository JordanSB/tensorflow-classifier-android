# Using Artificial Intelligence to help stop cash machine thefts in Northern Ireland | TensorFlow (1.4.0) Image Classifier

You might have heard that in recent months there’s been a huge increase in ATM thefts throughout Northern Ireland. The total as it stands is now at 11. Not only do these attacks have financial implications on the businesses that are targeted, but also causes disruption in the local communities.

So, how can AI help to stop these criminals from continuing to attack ATMs? Using machine learning I’ve trained a model with over 1000 images that will detect diggers and different plant machinery and alert the owners.

I've written a Medium [Article][Article] where you can find out more about this.

## Running the project

The app can run on most android devices from a second hand £30 handset to the most modern devices. All the phone requires is a PAYG sim card as it need internet to send texts. If you want to run the project for yourself follow these steps:

- Clone the project, and checkout the tag `1.4.0`
- Import it on Android Studio
- Run it
- That's all.

I'd like to thank [Nilhcem][Nilhcem] for porting the TensorFlow app to support image classification so quickly.
